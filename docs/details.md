The highlighted blue button will open the collection details editor window.

The highlighted `key` will copy that collection's server *website* administration password and the `globe` will open the server website

Right clicking on a collection will bring up a context menu where you can copy most of the detail data to the clipboard.

## Editing Collection Details

Clicking on the blue edit details button will bring up the details for that collection. You will find a number of options in there.

### Favorite Collection

### Removable Store Collection

![Alt text](img/detail-013.png)

This option marks the collection as existing on removable storage.  Usually when a collection folder disappears (you've deleted it), Mod Assistant will automatically forget it and never try and scan it again.  This prevents that, and the folder will be re-scanned when it next appears.

### Holding Pen Collection
