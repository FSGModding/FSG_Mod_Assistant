## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do you have any time saving tips?

Yes. Think about adding your `Downloads` folder to the program to easily move or copy new mods into your collections.  Mod Assist is pretty smart about what is and isn't a mod, and will happily ignore anything else that might be in your `Downloads` folder.  For bonus points, set your `Downloads` folder to be of the 'Holding Pen' type (see collection details)

### What should I do if something doesn't work?

Please, report it to us!

Please [Open an Issue](https://github.com/FSGModding/FSG_Mod_Assistant/issues/new/choose) and let me know what.  If it is specific to a mod, let me know where to get the mod.  You can also hit CTRL+ALT+D in the app to bring up the debug log - sending that too might be a good idea.

If the app hard crashes (you'll get a popup message), the crash log can be found in (v1.2.0+ only):

`C:\Users\YOU\AppData\Roaming\fsg-mod-assistant` - please include `crash.log` and `assist.log` in your issue report.  Thanks!

### Does this support Linux or Mac?

No, not at this time.  We lack the resources and hardware to properly test it.

### Does this support symLinks?

One method to keep the size of a mod collection down is to use symlinks - Mod Assistant is aware of symlinks, and will treat them much like the game does - like any other mod file.  Mod Assistant does not have any sort of built in sym link functions, you'll need a third party app or advanced knowledge of the command line to create them.

When doing file operations

- `Move`ing a symlink will move the __LINK DESCRIPTOR__ (the linked file remains unchanged)
- `Copy`ing a symlink will copy the __ORIGINAL FILE__ (the linked file is duplicated)
- `Delete`ing a symlink will delete the __LINK DESCRIPTOR__ (the linked file remains unchanged)

Note that invalid links in your folders will be ignored, however a warning message will be added to the debug log.

Due to how windows handles the permission for creating symlinks, it is not currently possible for Mod Assistant to make them

### How does the mod cache work?

This app uses a mod cache based on mod file name, size, and date. As such, it only needs to scan a mod once. Unzipped mods, broken mods, and files that don't appear to be mods are not added to the cache.  The `broken mods` item is important as if you have a _lot_ of broken mods in your mod folder, it can slow down the startup of the app.

Also, be aware, that sometimes when adding a new feature, the cache may need to be re-created, making the loading time increase a great deal.

If you are syncing your mods between multiple computers, and Mod Assistant insists on re-scanning everything constantly, take a look at the "OneDrive Sync Mode" in user preferences.
