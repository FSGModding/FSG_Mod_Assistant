## Move or Copy

Moving or copying files brings up a confirmation window.  Choose a destination to and press the `Yes` button to continue.  You can choose to overwrite files if you like, check the box next to the conflicting mods.  You can press `CTRL+A` to select all, and `CTRL+SHIFT+A` to deselect all

## Delete

Press the delete button to open a confirmation dialog to delete mods from a collection.  This operation **does** remove the file from disk completely - it can **not** be undone.  Press the `Yes` button to continue.
